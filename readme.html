Here is some sample code I've written using Python! 

The cdw_project example is a Python script that was used at my time with CDW. When the code is running, it 
takes in all active tickets from ServiceNow, checks if any tickets need data collected or have the 
capability to be closed/escalated by the script, then goes through each ticket to collect data and 
determine the future state of the ticket. As well, the script uses a dict to take information from 
the ServiceNow ticket and execute the proper function. For improvements, the following may be beneficial:
 - set up a maximum limit that a ticket is closed before it is immediately escalated (prevents an infinite
   cycle of tickets getting opened, then being forcefully closed)
 - convert the dict to an HTML file that can be viewed and edited simpler, rather than using a dict or 
   YAML file

The json_project example is my attempt at creating a JSON parser from scratch. Given a .txt file it will output
the size of the each object and list, the type of each item, and the values of each item. This is still 
in a work in progress.

The database_project is a PHP project from my time at Bradley University. When ran, it creates a website
that takes in three different csv files and adds the data to a MySQL database. As well, the website provides 
a way to view the data in the tables affected from each csv file.
